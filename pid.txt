Introduction
The EPF heat exchanger system (JT skid) is a unit in the Khor Mor gas plant that cools high-pressure natural gas to extract condensate (NGLs) and water before the gas goes to the sales pipeline. Cooling is achieved by first exchanging heat between the incoming gas and cold fluids (in multiple heat exchangers), then dropping the gas pressure across a Joule-Thomson (JT) valve (also called a choke or PCV-4050). This JT expansion causes the gas to rapidly cool. The cold gas-liquid mixture then enters a cold separator (V-405), where liquids are knocked out and separated. Finally, the dry, cold gas is warmed up (by exchanging heat with the incoming gas stream) and sent on to compression or export1.
The system has two P&IDs: one for the JT Skid & ESD/Header Skid and one for the Gas/Gas Exchangers (E-403A/B). Together, they show all the major equipment: heat exchangers E-401A/B/C, E-403A/B, E-402, the JT valve PCV-4050, the cold separator V-405, and associated piping, valves, and instruments. In simple terms, E-401A/B/C, E-403A/B, and E-402 are all parallel heat exchangers used to precool the gas, and V-405 is the separator vessel immediately downstream of them (after the JT valve), where the cooled gas separates from the liquids.
Below, we explain each component and how the flow moves through this system in layman’s terms. We’ll also cover the interconnections, the role of each part, operating conditions, and safety features per the P&IDs.
Inlet Gas Enters – Pre-Cooling Stage
High-pressure gas from upstream separators flows into the JT skid. It splits into multiple paths and passes through several heat exchangers to be cooled by colder fluids.
Joule-Thomson (JT) Expansion – Rapid Cooling
The gas streams recombine and go through the JT valve (PCV-4050). The valve drops the gas pressure, causing a significant temperature drop (Joule-Thomson effect) which further cools the gas and condenses liquids.
Cold Separation – Liquid Knockout
The cold, two-phase mixture enters the cold separator V-405. Inside this vessel, heavy hydrocarbon condensate and water (with MEG) fall out of the gas. The separated liquid collects at the bottom while dry gas rises to the top.
Gas Re-Warming and Export
The cold dry gas leaving V-405 flows back through the heat exchangers (on the opposite side) to warm up by absorbing heat from the incoming gas. After warming, this gas goes to the sales pipeline or compressors as “dry” product gas. 
Liquid Handling – Condensate & Glycol Recovery
Condensed liquids from V-405 (hydrocarbon condensate and water mixed with glycol) are drained out. Condensate is sent for stabilization/storage, and the glycol-water mixture goes to the regeneration unit to reclaim MEG for reuse.
Main Components and Their Functions
Let’s identify the main components shown in the P&IDs and explain each in simple terms, including their tag names (labels on the P&ID), function, and how they connect in the system.
Heat Exchangers E-401A/B/C (Gas/Gas Exchangers)
What they are: E-401A, E-401B, and E-401C are shell-and-tube gas/gas heat exchangers. They are essentially large radiators that let two gas streams exchange heat without mixing. According to the P&ID legend, they have a combined heat exchange area of about 4,346 sq.ft (approx 404 m²)2, indicating their major role in cooling. They are designed for high pressure (up to ~99.3 bar or 1440 psig) and low temperature service (minimum design metal temp around -45.6°C)2, which means they are made of special steel and insulated due to the very cold conditions.
Function: These three exchangers work in parallel to pre-cool the incoming gas stream by transferring its heat to the cold gas leaving the cold separator (V-405). In other words, warm gas from upstream flows through one side of E-401A/B/C, while very cold gas exiting the process flows through the other side. Heat moves from the hot gas into the cold gas. This cools down the incoming gas significantly before it undergoes JT expansion. The outgoing cold gas is simultaneously warmed up so it’s not too cold when it goes to the export pipeline1.
All three E-401 units perform the same duty and are arranged in parallel to handle the large flow. Splitting the flow among three exchangers provides enough cooling surface area and also allows flexibility – one unit can be taken out of service for maintenance while the others continue working. (The system has double block-and-bleed valves so that one set of exchangers can be isolated and the other trains still operate3.)
Connections: The inlet of each E-401A/B/C is fed by the high-pressure gas coming from the inlet manifold (after the production separators). In the P&ID, the gas feed line splits into three paths to enter E-401A, B, and C in parallel3. The outlets of E-401A/B/C merge back together into a common line leading to the JT valve. On the other side, cold gas from the separator (V-405) is distributed to the shell side of each E-401A/B/C as the cooling medium, and then these cold gas streams combine and leave the exchangers as a single warmed gas stream (going to the sales gas line)1. In summary, incoming gas and cold outlet gas flow in opposite directions through E-401 exchangers, exchanging heat.
In layman terms: Think of E-401A/B/C as three parallel radiators that let the hot incoming gas cool down by warming up the cold gas that’s leaving the system. By the time the gas goes through these, it has given up a lot of heat (cooling down), and the cold gas from the separator has picked up that heat (warming up)1.
Heat Exchangers E-403A/B (Gas/Gas Exchangers)
What they are: E-403A and E-403B are additional gas/gas heat exchangers, very similar in purpose to E-401 units. They were added in a later expansion (project ER-285) to increase cooling capacity3. E-403A/B appear on a separate “Gas/Gas Exchangers” skid P&ID. Each has about 107.9 m² area4 (≈1160 sq.ft each), and like E-401’s, they are constructed for ~99 bar pressure and low temps (MDMT -50°C range)4.
Function: E-403A/B perform the same heat exchange function as E-401, pre-cooling the incoming gas by transferring heat to cold gas. In current operation, the gas flow is split between the E-401 train and the E-403 train – effectively all five exchangers (401A/B/C and 403A/B) act in parallel to cool the inlet gas stream3. The inclusion of E-403 in parallel means more gas can be cooled (higher throughput) or the gas can be cooled to a lower temperature before the JT valve.
Connections: The inlet gas header splits such that some gas flows through E-401A/B/C and some through E-403A/B3. On the cold side, the outlet gas from the separator V-405 is likewise routed through both sets of exchangers. The P&IDs show lines “to Gas/Gas Exchanger skid E-403A/B” and “from Gas/Gas Exchanger skid E-403A/B”, indicating that the E-403 skid is tied into the same loops as E-401. In effect, E-401 and E-403 exchangers all share the same inlet gas feed and the same cold gas return, operating as a combined parallel bank.
Just like E-401, the E-403A/B exchangers can be isolated as a set. In fact, the five gas/gas exchangers are grouped into two sets: the original E-401 A/B/C in one set, and new E-403 A/B in another. Each set has its own block valves (with double block & bleed) so that one entire set can be taken offline if needed3. For example, operators could bypass the E-403 skid and just use E-401s, or vice versa, when performing maintenance or if one set fails.
Layman’s analogy: E-403A/B are two extra cooling units installed to help out the original three E-401 units. Together, these five heat exchangers all cool the gas by the same method (using the cold outgoing gas to chill the incoming gas). More exchangers in parallel = more cooling capacity or the ability to take one set offline without stopping the process3.
Heat Exchanger E-402 (Gas/Liquid Exchanger)
What it is: E-402 is a gas/liquid heat exchanger. Unlike E-401/403 (which use cold gas as the coolant), E-402 uses a cold liquid stream to cool the gas. The P&ID data calls it a “Gas/Liquid Exchanger” with about 457 sq.ft of area2. It’s also built to similar pressure specs (~1440 psi MAWP) with a low-temperature design (MDMT around -20 to -29°C)2. The liquid involved here is the cold condensate from the separator.
Function: E-402 recovers cold from the condensate liquid and uses it to further cool the incoming gas. When the gas pressure is dropped across the JT valve, heavy hydrocarbons condense into a very cold liquid (condensate) in V-405. That condensate is actually a useful cold source. So, before sending the condensate to storage, the plant runs the incoming gas against the cold condensate in E-402. This achieves two things simultaneously: it cools the gas a bit more (improving liquid recovery) and warms up the condensate (which is beneficial for downstream handling, as extremely cold liquid could cause issues).
In summary, E-402 acts like an economizer: cold condensate from the separator is routed through E-402 to chill the incoming gas, thereby prewarming the condensate and pre-cooling the gas.
Connections: E-402 is also arranged in parallel to the other exchangers on the gas side. The high-pressure gas feed is split such that a portion of the gas flows through E-402 (while the rest goes through the gas/gas exchangers)3. All these streams (E-401, E-403, E-402 outlets) join together before entering the JT valve. On the liquid side, E-402 is connected to the condensate outlet of V-405. The cold condensate coming out of V-405 is piped through E-402, absorbing heat from the incoming gas. After passing through E-402, the now slightly warmed condensate goes to a level control valve (LCV) and onward to the condensate stabilization system or storage. The P&ID indeed notes LCV-4052 “on condensate line downstream of gas/liquid exchanger E-402”5 – this valve controls flow of condensate out of V-405 and is placed after E-402. Thus, V-405’s condensate is forced to flow through E-402 whenever it leaves the separator.
It’s important to note that E-402 runs in parallel with the gas/gas exchangers (not in series). The user has indicated E-401, E-402, E-403 are all parallel, which the operating procedure confirms: the gas is split into two streams – one through the gas/gas exchangers (E-401 A/B/C and E-403 A/B) and the other through the gas/liquid exchanger (E-402)3. All streams then recombine. So E-402 handles a portion of the total gas flow, using cold condensate instead of cold gas to cool that portion.
Analogy: E-402 is like a small cooler that uses the cold drip liquid to chill some of the gas. By doing so, it also gently reheats that liquid. This clever exchange boosts efficiency – nothing goes to waste, and both the gas and liquid end up at more moderate temperatures.
JT Valve PCV-4050 (Joule-Thomson Expansion Valve)
What it is: Tag PCV-4050 is the JT valve, a Pressure Control Valve that reduces the gas pressure from the inlet pressure (~1140 psig in operation) down to a much lower pressure (~500 psig)4. It’s effectively a controlled choke valve or throttling device. In normal operation, it regulates the downstream pressure (or flow) and in doing so also triggers the cooling effect.
Function: This valve is the heart of the Joule-Thomson cooling process. When the pre-cooled high-pressure gas expands across PCV-4050, it undergoes an isoenthalpic expansion that causes a large drop in temperature. Essentially, after being pre-chilled in the exchangers, the gas might be, say, 0°C; then expanding through the JT valve can plunge it further to perhaps –20 or –30°C (depending on conditions). This is what causes the remaining heavier components and water vapor to condense out in the separator.
PCV-4050 is typically controlled to maintain a set pressure in the cold separator. For example, it might hold V-405 at ~500 psig while the upstream side (inlet of the valve) sees the higher wellhead pressure. By controlling pressure, it also indirectly controls temperature drop and flow rate.
On the P&ID, PCV-4050 is drawn at the outlet of the combined exchanger lines, just before the inlet of V-405. It likely has instrumentation like a pressure sensor (“PY-4050”) and controller to modulate it. Operators can adjust it to achieve the desired dewpoint control.
Connections: Upstream of PCV-4050 is the combined flow from all the heat exchangers. Downstream of PCV-4050 is the inlet to the cold separator V-405. So all gas must pass through this valve to get into the separator. There’s usually a bypass line as well (for start-up or if the valve needs maintenance), but under normal conditions PCV-4050 is the only path and is throttling.
Design/Operation: Because of the high pressure drop, this valve is built as a choke. The term XCV-4050 appears on the P&ID (with annotation “CHOKE”)2, indicating it’s a choke valve. It must handle two-phase flow (since some liquid can form right after the valve). The outlet temperature can be very low, so materials here are also low-temperature service. The valve is often accompanied by a heater or the upstream exchangers precisely to avoid freezing it with hydrates – in our system, the MEG injection ensures hydrates (ice-like methane clathrates) don’t form at the JT valve or downstream.
Safety: On an emergency shutdown, PCV-4050 will fail-closed (or is commanded closed) to stop flow. The P&ID and procedures indicate that PCV-4050 closes on ESD5. It’s a critical valve; if it fails or if too much flows, the downstream could overpressure or overcool. For backup, there are relief devices (see PSV-4051 below) protecting the downstream.
In simple words: The JT valve is like an automatic pressure regulator valve. It’s half open most of the time, holding the separator at a lower pressure. When gas squeezes through this valve, it cools down dramatically (just like how an aerosol spray can feels cold when you release pressure). That extra chilling is what causes heavy gas components to condense into liquids which can be removed in the next stage.
Cold Separator V-405 (Three-Phase Separator Vessel)
What it is: V-405 is the Cold Separator, a large pressure vessel where the cold expanded gas is allowed to separate into gas and liquids. This vessel is often also called the JT separator or cold catch-pot. It’s a vertical three-phase separator in this case (since it separates gas, hydrocarbon liquid, and aqueous glycol/water). The P&ID describes it as 60" O.D × 20'-0" S/S (seam-to-seam), with design pressure 1440 psi @ 120°F and MDMT -40°F2. In other words, it’s 5 feet in diameter and about 20 feet tall, built to withstand the high pressure and low temperature. It likely has an internal baffle or mist extractor to help coalesce liquids.
Function: V-405 provides a quiet zone for the cold gas to drop out its liquids. When the cold mist of gas, condensate, and water/MEG enters V-405, the sudden decrease in velocity and gravity do their work: the heavier liquids fall to the bottom of the vessel, and the dry gas rises to the top. Inside, there are actually two liquid phases that separate: an oil/condensate layer (hydrocarbons) and a water+glycol layer (since MEG – monoethylene glycol – is water-miscible and will collect with any produced water). V-405 is designed as a three-phase separator to handle this. It will have a weir or boot for the water phase and a separate outlet for oil phase.
The result is that V-405 delivers dry gas (gas with a much lower dew point, meaning it’s had most of the condensable removed) out its top, and it collects natural gas condensate (light hydrocarbon liquids) and water/MEG in the bottom. Removing these liquids is the whole point of the JT skid: to meet pipeline specs and recover valuable condensate.
Connections & Internals: The inlet from PCV-4050 enters typically near the middle and may have an inlet diverter. Gas flows upward and exits via the top nozzle to the gas outlet line. Liquid droplets either drop out by gravity or get knocked out by an internal demister pad. The liquids collect in the lower part of the vessel (often called the “cold separator boot”). There are two outlet nozzles at the bottom: one draws off the hydrocarbon condensate and the other draws off the water/MEG mixture (from the water boot).
For control, V-405 has level transmitters and level control valves on each liquid outlet. According to the P&ID, LCV-4052 controls the condensate outflow (keeping the interface between condensate and gas at the right level) and LCV-4053 controls the water/MEG outflow (maintaining the interface between water and oil)5. There are also level safety switches (e.g., high-high level alarms LSHH) that can trigger shut-downs if the liquid level rises too much (to avoid liquid carryover into the gas line)2.
The gas outlet at the top of V-405 goes to the rest of the plant – in the original design it directly flowed through the exchangers (to cool incoming gas) and then on to the sales gas pipeline. In the modified design, there is also a Cold Gas Scrubber V-406 installed just downstream (see below), but essentially V-405 is the primary separation of liquids.
Operating conditions: V-405 operates at a lower pressure (on the order of hundreds of psi). It’s equipped with a pressure safety valve PSV-4051 to protect it. The P&ID shows PSV-4051 set at 1400 PSIG (96.5 bar) for thermal/pressure relief2. This PSV will vent to the flare header if V-405’s pressure exceeds safe limits (for example, due to external heat or a valve failure). Additionally, the P&ID’s general note specifies that blowdown and PSV valves should be located at high points in the system4 – indeed V-405 has its PSV at the top. There is also a blowdown line on V-405 (to depressurize it during shutdowns) and drains at the bottom for maintenance4.
The vessel is insulated to minimize external heat gain and to prevent atmospheric moisture from condensing/freezing on its walls (all cold equipment and lines are marked “INSUL.” for insulation on the P&IDs)2.
Summary in plain terms: V-405 is like a big cold sump where cold gas enters and the liquids knock out due to gravity. The gas leaves from the top, and two types of liquids (condensate and glycol-water) collect at the bottom. It’s the crucial separator that makes sure the outgoing sales gas is dry and that the liquids can be recovered separately.
Cold Gas Scrubber V-406 (Downstream Scrubber)
What it is: V-406 (Cold Gas Scrubber) is a smaller separator added downstream of V-405’s gas outlet. It is not shown in the initial question list, but it appears on the P&IDs (“from Cold Gas Scrubber V-406” is noted on the exchanger sheet) and in the updated operating procedures. V-406 is essentially a polishing scrubber to catch any residual liquid droplets that might carry over from V-405 at higher gas flow rates3. It was added as part of an upgrade to ensure no condensate gets into the compressors or pipeline when throughput increased.
Function: V-406 simply takes the gas from V-405 and removes any last traces of liquid (if V-405 was ever overwhelmed). Under normal conditions, V-405 should remove most liquids, so V-406 is a safety net for entrained mist. It protects downstream equipment (like the export compressors) from liquid slugging.
Connections: The gas line from V-405’s top goes up into V-406. Separated droplets in V-406 are drained via a line that returns by gravity back into V-405’s liquid section3. (It is installed at a higher elevation above V-405, so any liquid it collects can simply flow down into V-405’s boot by gravity.) The dry gas out of V-406 then continues to the sales gas header/compressor suction. Essentially, V-406 is in series after V-405 for the gas stream.
Note: Since V-406 is a later addition, it might not be fully detailed on the original P&IDs provided, but it is described in the documents. For completeness: after the cold scrubber, the gas is truly “bone dry” and goes on to the export pipeline or is recompressed if needed.
Ethylene Glycol Injection System
What it is: The JT skid includes an Ethylene Glycol (EG) injection system (often specifically MEG – Monoethylene Glycol). This consists of injection points (labeled CI-401A, CI-401B, CI-401C on the P&ID for the three exchangers2) and associated pump/skid (the glycol regeneration & pumping unit R-201). The injection quills are indicated on the P&ID with tags like GL-101, GL-102, etc., each with a check valve4.
Function: The glycol injection is a hydrate prevention measure. As the gas cools to low temperatures, any residual water can form hydrate crystals (ice-like solids that can plug valves and lines). Injecting MEG into the gas absorbs water and depresses the freezing point, preventing hydrate formation. Essentially, the glycol acts like antifreeze. It also helps de-water the gas (the absorbed water will drop out with the glycol in V-405, becoming the water/glycol phase).
In this system, MEG is injected at multiple points on the JT skid – predominantly before the JT valve and into the gas streams entering the exchangers3. The operating procedure notes there are seven injection points on the skid. P&ID general note 3 explicitly states “Injection quill with integral check valve”4 – meaning each injection point is a quill that sprays glycol into the gas, with a one-way valve to prevent backflow.
Connections: Lean MEG (i.e., water-free glycol) is supplied from the Glycol Regeneration unit (R-201) through small bore piping (often 1/2” or so) to injection points upstream of the JT valve and at the exchangers. The exact tags GL-101, GL-102 on the P&ID correspond to these injection lines. For example, there might be injection upstream of E-401 and at the inlet of PCV-4050. The glycol mixes with the gas and travels with it through the JT expansion and into V-405. In V-405, the glycol and water drop out together (the “water/MEG” phase). That mixture is then sent back to the regen unit to remove the water and reuse the glycol.
Operation: Operators will regulate the glycol flow to maintain enough concentration in the gas to inhibit hydrates. Too little glycol and hydrates could form; too much and you’re just wasting chemical. The system likely has a reclaim pump for rich glycol from V-405 (to send it to R-201) and a circulation pump for lean glycol.
In simple terms: Glycol injection is like adding antifreeze into the gas. It keeps any water in the gas from turning into ice. The glycol captures the water, and then both are removed together in the separator. The P&IDs highlight these points – ensuring there’s a check-valved quill so glycol can be injected safely without gas blowing back4. This is a critical part of keeping the JT skid running reliably.
Level and Pressure Control Instruments
While not “modules,” it’s worth noting the key control instruments shown on the P&IDs, as they are crucial to making the system work:
LCV-4052 (Level Control Valve) – Controls the condensate liquid level in V-405. It modulates the flow of condensate (hydrocarbon liquid) out of the separator (after it passes through E-402) to keep the liquid level within set limits5. If level rises, LCV-4052 opens more to drain condensate faster. On an emergency shutdown, this valve closes to avoid draining during upset5.
LCV-4053 (Level Control Valve) – Controls the water/MEG level (interface) in V-405’s boot. It adjusts the water/glycol outflow to maintain the interface level. It sends the rich glycol/water to the regen unit. Also fails closed on ESD5.
LSHH-4050 / LSHH-4051 (Level Switch High-High) – These are high-high level switches on V-405 (4050 might be for condensate compartment, 4051 for water boot). If liquid rises too high (meaning the separator might flood), they trigger alarms or a shutdown to protect the process2.
PCV-4050 (JT Valve) – The pressure control instrumentation around the JT valve ensures it maintains the correct downstream pressure. Tag “PY-4050” likely refers to the pressure sensor (transmitter) that measures separator pressure and feeds the controller “PIC-4050” that drives the valve position. This loop keeps the cold separator at its set pressure.
Pressure Safety Valves (PSV-4051, etc.) – PSV-4051 is mounted on V-405 set at ~1400 psig2 to protect it from overpressure. Another PSV (tag not fully clear, possibly PSV-4050) might exist on the inlet side for thermal relief of the exchanger network. The P&ID note indicates thermal relief valves where needed (general note 4 mentions a thermal PSV)2. These valves will automatically vent gas to the flare header if pressure exceeds the limit, preventing explosions or burst equipment.
Temperature and Pressure Indicators (TIT, PIT) – Scattered through the P&ID are temperature indicators (TIs) and pressure indicators (PIs) at key points: e.g. TIC-4050 might monitor JT outlet temperature; TIT-4010/4011 might measure exchanger temps. These provide the operators readings of how cold the gas is getting and help in controlling the process. (For instance, a temperature indicator downstream of the JT valve helps verify the cooling performance).
Flow indicators (FI) – There might be a flow indicator on the gas (FE-4050) or on the condensate line (FT). The text snippet shows FE-401A/B and FT-201 etc in system but it’s not critical for understanding – essentially they measure production rates from well test and total gas flow.
Emergency Shutdown (ESD) Valves and Blowdown System
ESD Valves: The skid is equipped with Emergency Shutdown (ESD) valves that can isolate the process in case of an emergency (fire, high pressure, etc.). From the tag list, ESD-101 is likely the incoming 10” ESD valve on the feed line to the JT skid6, and ESD-102 might be on the outlet line. These valves are typically fail-closed, fast-acting valves. In an ESD event, they slam shut, halting flow of gas into and out of the skid to contain any issue. For example, the operations manual indicates SDV-011 and SDV-012 (likely corresponding to ESD valves) on the 10” inlet and outlet lines will close on an ESD trip5.
Blowdown (BDV) Valves: To relieve the pressure from the system during an emergency or shutdown, blowdown valves open to vent gas to the flare. The JT skid has blowdown valves tagged BDV-4010 and BDV-4030 on the inlet side of the heat exchangers5. These are located at high points (the inlet gas header) as per design note. On ESD, BDV-4010 and BDV-4030 automatically open to dump the pressurized gas in the exchangers and inlet line to the flare stack safely5. Similarly, there will be a blowdown on V-405 (could be through the PSV or a separate BDV) to depressurize the separator. The principle is to reduce pressure quickly to mitigate hazards in an emergency.
The P&ID shows restrictive orifices RO-4030 and RO-4031 in the blowdown path to flare4. These are plates with a fixed small hole to limit flow rate. According to a note, one orifice (RO-4030) is currently a full bore (no restriction) and the second (RO-4031) is sized to protect the flare system from overpressure during manual blowdown, because the existing flare line is undersized4. This was a temporary measure: when the flare line is upgraded in the future, they plan to resize these orifices (make RO-4030 restrictive and RO-4031 full bore) as per API-5214. In plain terms, they intentionally limit how fast the skid can blow down so as not to overload the flare system. This is an interesting design nuance: it prevents a sudden rush of gas to the flare in an emergency.
Fire and Gas Sensors: Not explicitly asked, but typically such a skid will have fire detectors or gas leak detectors that tie into the ESD system, ensuring that if a fire is detected, those ESD valves close and BDVs open. The control and interlock section of the ops manual (and the P&ID legend) would detail these. (For instance, “ESD-101” might close on detection of high-high level, or high pressure, or fire, etc.)
Power Fail Safe Positions: All actuated valves have defined fail positions. Generally: ESD valves fail closed, blowdown valves fail open, level control valves fail closed (to avoid draining the vessel when not controlled), PCV-4050 likely fails closed to stop flow. These ensure a safe state if power or instrument air is lost. The P&ID tagging like “ZD” or “ZS” on valves indicates their fail state (e.g., ZSO = solenoid, open state; FO = fail open, etc.) – but that’s detail beyond lay explanation.
Simplified: In an emergency, the skid will shut itself off and depressurize. Big inlet/outlet valves close to isolate the skid, and special vent valves open to dump the gas to the flare. This prevents pressure build-up or feeding a fire. The P&IDs show these emergency valves (for example, BDV-4010 on the inlet line) which open to flare when triggered5. Meanwhile, the JT valve slams shut and the liquid valves close so everything is contained. The system can thus safely blow down without bursting and without sending liquid slugs to the flare (the restrictor ensures a controlled vent rate)4.
Process Flow Description (Putting It All Together)
Now that each component has been identified, let’s walk through the overall workflow step by step, from the inlet of the JT skid to the outlets, in plain language:
Inlet from Production Separators: The gas entering the JT skid is coming from the upstream production separators (which knocked out bulk liquids from the wellhead gas). This gas is still at high pressure (roughly 1000–1200 psi) and is “wet” – it still holds vapors of heavier hydrocarbons and water that didn’t condense at warmer temperatures. An operator would ensure the ESD inlet valve (say ESD-101) is open to allow gas into the skid. The gas first passes through an inlet header where a manual choke or flow control may reside (the P&ID mentions a choke valve upstream, but that might be on each well flow line). For the JT skid, assume the gas flows freely into the heat exchanger section.
Flow Splitting to Exchangers: At the inlet of the exchanger network, the gas splits into multiple parallel streams. Part of the gas goes through E-401A/B/C (shell-and-tube exchangers) and part goes through E-403A/B, and part through E-402. In practice, E-401 and E-403 are fed by a common header, so effectively the gas is splitting five ways (for five gas/gas exchanger tubes) plus one more way into E-402. The split is determined by flow resistances – typically each exchanger leg is balanced to take an equal share. This parallel arrangement is confirmed by the operations manual: “The gas is split into two streams and pre-cooled by gas/gas exchangers (E-401 A/B/C and E-403 A/B) and gas/liquid exchanger (E-402)”3.
Pre-Cooling in Heat Exchangers: As the gas passes through these exchangers, it is cooling down substantially. How? – On the other side of the exchanger walls, cold streams are absorbing heat from the gas:
In E-401/E-403 (gas/gas), the cold stream is the outgoing dry gas from the cold separator. This gas entered the exchangers at maybe –20°C and by absorbing heat from the incoming gas it might leave at, say, +15°C. Correspondingly, the incoming gas that entered at +35°C might leave the exchanger at, say, +0°C. (These numbers are illustrative.)
In E-402 (gas/liquid), the cold stream is the condensate liquid from the separator. That condensate might be at –20°C as well; as it absorbs heat, it might warm to –5°C, while the gas cools a bit further.
By the time the gas streams reconverge after these exchangers, they are significantly chilled. The exchangers have effectively recovered cold from the process’s own products to cool the incoming gas, a very energy-efficient design. This pre-cooling means that when the gas expands in the next step, it will drop to an even lower absolute temperature, maximizing liquids recovery.
(While cooling, some heavy hydrocarbons could even condense inside the exchangers if sufficiently cold. If so, those would be carried into V-405 as well. The system must be designed to handle two-phase flow after the JT valve, which it is.)
Recombining and JT Expansion: After the heat exchangers, all the gas paths join back into a single stream. Now the gas (though cooled) is still at high pressure. Next it goes through the JT Valve (PCV-4050). This valve deliberately constricts the flow and drops the pressure from ~1000+ psi down to around 500 psi (for example). This pressure drop causes the gas to expand and cool further – likely to the coldest temperature in the process. It is at this point that a lot of the remaining vapors turn into liquid droplets (think of moisture condensing when warm air rapidly expands and cools). Ethylene glycol is mixed in the gas here to ensure any water turns to liquid water/MEG rather than ice. Right after the valve, the gas is a cold mist (gas with fine droplets of condensate and water/MEG).
Analogy: The JT valve is like opening a pressurized spray can – as the pressure falls, the contents get very cold. The pre-cooling by the exchangers ensured that the spray coming out is even colder than it would be otherwise, so more liquid “rain” forms.
Cold Separator (V-405): Immediately after expanding through the valve, the two-phase gas enters V-405, the cold separator. Here, the velocity drops and the mixture has time to settle. Heavy hydrocarbon droplets and water/MEG droplets fall to the bottom of the vessel. Inside V-405, you now have three layers: gas on top, a layer of hydrocarbon condensate in the middle of the sump, and a water/glycol layer at the bottom of the sump (because glycolated water is denser than hydrocarbons). V-405 is doing the job of separating these phases.
The dry gas, now freed of most liquids, exits out the top of V-405. This gas is at a much lower pressure than when it came in, and it’s very cold (maybe -20 to -30°C). It contains mostly methane/ethane and no liquid hydrocarbons to speak of. The P&ID calls this gas the “Cold Gas” and sends it onward.
Meanwhile, liquid condensate (light oil) is accumulating in V-405’s lower section. So is water mixed with MEG. Because two liquids don’t mix, V-405 is designed to draw them off separately. A internal weir or boot in the separator keeps the water/MEG separated. Level controllers ensure neither layer overfills: LCV-4052 lets condensate out when the condensate level rises, and LCV-4053 lets water/MEG out when that interface rises5.
Periodically or continuously, condensate is withdrawn via LCV-4052. It flows through E-402 (getting reheated there) and then goes to the condensate handling system (in Khor Mor, condensate from EPF can be routed to an EPF stabilizer or to the main plant’s stabilizer where it’s further processed and then stored). The condensate is a valuable product (basically natural gas liquids).
Similarly, rich glycol (with water) is withdrawn via LCV-4053 from the water boot and sent to the regeneration system (R-201). In R-201, this mixture will be boiled to remove water, producing lean MEG which is recycled back as injection. Produced water goes to disposal or treatment. So the glycol is continuously recycled in a closed loop.
Cold Gas Out and Warming: The cold dry gas leaving V-405 now goes to the outlet of the JT skid. Originally, it directly went through the exchangers to warm up by heating the incoming gas streams (regaining the heat it gave up earlier). In the current configuration, it first passes through Cold Gas Scrubber V-406 which catches any tiny droplets that escaped V-405 (especially at high flow). Those droplets drain back to V-405 as described. After V-406, the dry gas is essentially 100% vapor, no liquids. It then passes through the shell side of the E-401/E-403 exchangers, as mentioned, warming up as it pre-cools the inlet gas1. By the time it exits the exchangers, it may be close to ambient temperature again. (It does not pass through E-402 because E-402 is only a gas/liquid unit for the inlet side; the gas goes through E-401/403 shells for reheating.)
Finally, the gas goes through an outlet ESD valve (say ESD-102 or SDV on the 10” line) and enters the sales gas pipeline or the compressor suction for further handling. At Khor Mor, the EPF gas either feeds the export pipeline directly or goes to a booster compressor (EPF compressors) if needed to raise pressure. The P&ID shows the tie-ins: “To EPF Compressors / Sales Gas Pipeline” on the outlet4. In normal operation, the gas is now of sales quality – meeting dew point specs (no further condensation will occur at pipeline conditions). It can be mixed with other dry gas streams and delivered to customers.
Support Systems: Throughout this flow, the instrumentation and safety systems are actively ensuring stable and safe operation. For example:
The JT valve throttles to keep V-405 pressure stable.
The level controllers on V-405 modulate the liquid dump valves to keep the separator from flooding.
Temperature indicators are watched; if the JT outlet gets too cold, operators can adjust glycol injection or throttle the flow (extremely low temperatures can cause metallurgical issues).
If anything goes wrong – say the separator level gets too high (perhaps a dump valve failed) – a high-high level alarm (LSHH) might trigger an ESD trip that closes the inlet, stops flow, and opens blowdowns to prevent liquid carryover. The P&ID shows LSHH-4050 and LSHH-4051 (level switches) which likely connect to the shutdown system2.
In event of an emergency signal (fire, gas leak, or manual ESD activation), the system will execute the shutdown sequence: isolate and depressurize as described in the safety section above.
Drains and Maintenance: The P&IDs also indicate facilities for maintenance. For example, low-point drain valves are installed at points in the system to allow complete draining of liquids when the plant is down (general note 1: “Drains are located at low points in the system”4). Before maintenance, operators would isolate the skid, depressurize via BDVs, then open drains to remove any residual condensate/glycol. There are also high-point vents which can be opened to ensure no pressure remains. The multi-exchanger design means one train can be worked on while the other carries flow – e.g., they could isolate the E-403A/B skid via its block valves and continue running through E-401A/B/C (or vice versa), as long as capacity allows, which is a great operational flexibility for maintenance3.
By following the above steps, the EPF JT skid effectively captures valuable condensate and protects the downstream equipment, while delivering dry gas to the sales line. In layman’s summary:
Wet, pressurized gas in → multiple coolers (using cold output to pre-chill) → expansion valve (cools it a lot) → separator (drop out liquids) → dry gas out.
Every component we described plays a role in this sequence.
Operating Conditions and Special Considerations
This section highlights some specific technical details, operating parameters, and design considerations evident from the P&IDs:
Pressure and Temperature: The entire JT skid is designed for high pressures (up to ANSI 600# class). The exchangers and vessels have MAWP ~99 barg (1440 psig) which matches the upstream well pressures2. They also have to handle low temperatures: for instance, the gas/gas exchangers are rated down to about -45°C and the separator to -40°C2. In operation, the separator might actually run around -20 to -30°C, so there’s a safety margin. Materials like low-temperature carbon steel are used (e.g., the separator is likely made of LTCS to have a -40°F MDMT). Insulation (indicated as “INSUL.” on lines) is applied on the cold equipment and piping to minimize external heat leak and prevent ice formation on the outside2.
Flow Rates: While exact flow isn’t given on the P&ID, the EPF was designed initially for ~120 MMSCFD through the JT skid (this is hinted by a note: JT valve rate 123 MMSCFD at certain conditions)2. Debottlenecking projects increased capacity (hence adding E-403 and a cold scrubber). The multiple exchangers and added scrubber indicate they pushed more flow (maybe up to ~180 MMSCFD). The equipment sizing (exchanger areas, 60” separator) also corresponds to that order of magnitude of gas flow.
Recovered Condensate: The condensate condensed by this process is substantial. It can be on the order of tens or hundreds of barrels per day. The P&IDs tie the condensate out to either an EPF stabilizer tower or to the main plant. One note in the background docs says “EPF condensate production can be sent either to EPF stabilizer or main plant stabilizer”. So operationally, they ensure the cold condensate is slightly warmed (by E-402) and then directed to a stabilizer (a distillation column) which will strip lighter gases out, yielding a stable condensate (C5+ product) for storage. This is outside the JT skid itself, but worth knowing why E-402 warming the condensate is useful: it helps the stabilizer, as extremely cold feed could cause operational issues.
No Hydrates: Thanks to continuous MEG injection, the system is kept hydrate-free. The evidence is that none of the valves or pipes have ever shown plugging issues in the documentation, and the design includes ample injection points. The general note on the P&ID and the procedures both emphasize injection with integral check valves, showing how critical they consider this. The presence of a regeneration unit R-201 indicates they recover and reuse the glycol, which is typical for long-term operation.
No Liquid Pockets: The P&ID text has a note “SLOPE – NO POCKETS” on some lines2. This means all piping is sloped towards drain points and doesn’t have low spots where liquid could accumulate. This is especially important in cryogenic service: any pocket of liquid could collect and then cause slugging or corrosion. By sloping the lines, any condensate that forms will flow to the separator or drains instead of pooling.
Future Modification (Flare constraint): As mentioned, the restrictor orifices RO-4030/4031 were a temporary fix due to an undersized flare header branch. The note essentially says: in the future project ER-377, they plan to re-route the flare tie-in; once that is done, RO-4030 should be resized per proper API standards and RO-4031 made full bore4. This kind of note is a reminder of evolving infrastructure – it doesn’t affect operation except during blowdown, but it’s interesting. It shows the engineers anticipated a flare load issue if both BDVs popped open; by restricting one, they limited the flow to flare so the back-pressure won’t soar. For now, it’s a special condition (the plant operators likely have to be mindful that blowdown takes a bit longer due to this restriction).
Maintenance: The JT skid is designed for ease of maintenance:
Parallel trains allow equipment to be isolated. As noted, one set of exchangers can be taken out while the other remains in operation3. There are likely spectacle blinds or line blinds in the piping to positively isolate if needed.
Double block and bleed valves on critical isolation points (the insight from documentation: each set has DBB arrangements3). Double block and bleed means two isolation valves in series with a small bleed valve in between, so that if one leaks, the bleed will show it and the second still holds – this provides safer isolation for maintenance on high pressure lines.
Drains and vents everywhere needed, to fully depressurize and empty equipment before opening it up. We see drain points at low spots and vent points at high spots on the P&ID (though not explicitly listed above, typically present).
The MEG system itself requires maintenance: filters for the glycol, pump maintenance, and the regeneration reboiler, etc. But that’s on the glycol skid, not the JT skid proper.
Pigging: The P&ID mentions a Pig Launcher 02-L-001 and ESD valve KM-2 in the list of components6. This refers to the pig launcher on the sales gas pipeline and an emergency shutdown valve on the export line (KM-2 likely is at the tie-in to the main plant). These are peripheral but relevant: the dry gas line to sales likely has a pig launcher for pipeline pigging and an ESD that ties into the plant ESD system. So after the JT skid, those are the next elements on the gas export route.
Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting of the EPF JT Skid
Overview: To ensure the EPF JT skid (heat exchangers E-401/402/403, JT valve PCV-4050, cold separator V-405, etc.) is operating optimally, one must regularly monitor key performance metrics (pressures, temperatures, levels, flows) and analyze sensor data for any deviations. Performance issues often manifest as abnormal readings – by interpreting these in an “if this, then that” manner, operators can pinpoint problems and take corrective action. Below is a detailed guide on performance evaluation, real-time monitoring, and troubleshooting of each major component, followed by a summary of cause-and-effect relations (in if/then format).
Key Performance Metrics and Parameters
Monitoring performance involves tracking several critical parameters across the JT skid components:
Pressures: Inlet gas pressure (upstream of JT valve), separator pressure (downstream of JT valve), differential pressures across heat exchangers, and flare/PSV pressures. Stable pressure differentials indicate normal flow; rising pressures or swings can signal restrictions or control issues. For example, V-405 normally operates around a set pressure (e.g. ~500 psig); if it trends higher, the PCV may be struggling1.
Temperatures: Gas temperatures before and after each heat exchanger, JT valve outlet temperature, and separator temperature. Heat exchanger performance is gauged by the temperature drop (hot inlet vs cold outlet). The JT expansion should yield a very low temperature (target dew point ~ –15 °F for sales gas)2. Deviations here immediately affect liquid recovery.
Flow Rates: Gas flow through the skid (if a flow meter FT-4050 is installed), liquid condensate flow out of V-405, and MEG injection flow rate. These should align with design values for given conditions. A faulty flow transmitter can mislead operators – e.g. a known issue occurred with FT-4050 giving incorrect readings, which required correction1.
Levels: Liquid levels in V-405 (both condensate and water/MEG). Stable levels within normal range indicate the dump valves (LCV-4052/4053) are working properly. High-high level alarms or erratic level trends signal potential problems with level control or an influx of unexpected liquids.
Valve Positions: The opening percentage of the JT valve (PCV-4050) and the positions of LCVs are key indicators. For instance, PCV-4050 normally modulates to maintain separator pressure; if it’s continuously near 100% open (or fully closed often), that’s a sign of performance imbalance. Similarly, LCVs should modulate to hold set level – if an LCV is pegged fully open but level remains high, there’s likely a constraint downstream or valve issue.
Quality Metrics: Gas outlet hydrocarbon dew point (or moisture content), which indicates if the gas is truly “dry.” Liquid hydrocarbon yield (condensate volume) vs. expected. These outcomes measure overall skid performance: e.g., if dew point starts rising above spec, cooling performance or MEG effectiveness has dropped.
All these metrics are available via instrument sensors on the skid. By comparing real-time data against design values or baseline “healthy” performance, operators can detect when something is off. For example, the P&ID shows PSV-4051 set at 96.5 barg3 – the separator pressure should never approach this in normal operation; if the pressure trends upward abnormally, that’s a red flag (and indeed, minor PSV “passing” leaks have been observed when valves weren’t sealing perfectly1).
Ideal Procedure for Performance Checks
Checking equipment performance should be a routine part of operations. Here’s an ideal procedure:
1. Establish Baselines: First, know what “good” performance looks like. Use commissioning data or initial performance tests to note normal readings:
Temperature drops across each heat exchanger (e.g. inlet gas cooled from 35°C to 5°C, JT outlet typically -10°C, etc.).
Normal pressure drops (e.g. negligible pressure drop across clean exchangers, ~600 psi drop across JT valve).
Typical condensate and water production rates at given throughput.
Typical control valve positions (PCV, LCVs) at steady operation.
These baselines serve as reference points.
2. Daily Monitoring: During operation, continuously monitor sensor trends on the DCS/SCADA:
Watch the inlet and outlet temperatures of exchangers E-401/402/403. Trend the approach temperature (difference between hot gas in vs cold gas out). If this approach starts shrinking, the exchanger may be fouling (less heat transfer).
Check the JT valve outlet temperature and separator pressure. Ensure the JT valve (PCV-4050) is controlling within its normal range.
Observe V-405 levels and the behavior of LCV-4052/4053. They should modulate smoothly. Investigate any frequent oscillations or if either valve is at extreme positions for long periods.
Confirm MEG injection rate is at the required setpoint (especially during colder weather or high throughput).
Verify no unexpected alarms: e.g. high differential pressure across filters, high pressure in separator, high level, or hydrate detection if any.
3. Performance Test Runs: Periodically (e.g. monthly or after significant maintenance), conduct a performance test:
Ramp the gas flow to a high rate (if safe) and see if the skid can maintain outlet dew point and separator pressure. This tests capacity.
During this test, log all key sensor readings. Compare with design predictions. For example, at X MMSCFD, the JT valve should be around Y% open; is it consistent? Is condensate yield matching expectations?
If a test indicates degraded performance (e.g., lower condensate recovery than before, higher required pressure drop, etc.), schedule an investigative maintenance.
4. Physical Inspection: During planned shutdowns, perform visual and mechanical inspections:
Check heat exchanger internals for fouling or scaling. Clean the exchangers if fouling is found (this was indeed a routine maintenance in Khor Mor: “process clean of EPF exchanger – shell and tube side” is scheduled when needed1).
Inspect the JT valve trim for erosion or damage (a worn valve can leak or not throttle smoothly).
Inspect demister pads in V-405 and verify no damage or plugging.
Calibrate critical instruments (pressure transmitters, temperature sensors, level trolls, etc.) to avoid drift that could mask real issues.
Test the operation of control valves and ESD valves under controlled conditions (stroke testing) to ensure they respond fully and without sticking.
5. Analyze Trends Over Time: Utilize the historian data to spot long-term trends:
For instance, if over 6 months the cold separator pressure had to be gradually lowered to achieve the same dew point, that might indicate exchanger performance decline.
Or if PCV-4050 opening has been creeping up to maintain pressure, throughput might be pushing past design or exchangers are fouling.
A slow decline in condensate production per unit of gas can signal performance loss in cooling (less condensation happening).
Following this procedure, you effectively create a feedback loop: monitor continuously, test periodically, inspect during downtime, and address any discrepancy. This proactive approach catches issues early (e.g., noticing a slight drop in exchanger efficiency before it becomes a major problem).
Safety during performance checks is paramount: never push equipment beyond safe limits (e.g., do not intentionally exceed pressure/temperature ratings). Always follow plant procedures and use proper PPE, especially when doing physical inspections or adjustments.
Detecting Performance Issues via Real-Time Data
Real-time sensor data is your first line of defense to detect issues. Here’s how various sensor readings can reveal specific problems:
Temperature Deviations: If the JT valve outlet temperature rises above normal (meaning the gas isn’t as cold as it should be), it could indicate:
Insufficient pre-cooling by the exchangers (maybe fouled exchangers or a bypass inadvertently open).
Lower pressure drop than normal across the JT (maybe PCV not throttling enough due to a fault or lower upstream pressure).
Immediate check: Compare the current exchanger inlet/outlet temps to baseline. If exchangers are indeed delivering warmer gas than usual, focus there. If exchanger temps are fine but JT outlet is warm, the JT valve may be suspect.
Pressure Changes: If separator pressure (PT-4050) starts climbing and approaches the PSV set point3, you likely have a problem maintaining control:
PCV-4050 might be unable to pass enough flow (perhaps it’s stuck or partially blocked by ice).
Or the gas flow rate has increased beyond design (valve at full capacity).
Immediate check: Look at PCV-4050 valve position. If it’s 100% open and pressure is high, the flow is exceeding capacity or there’s a downstream restriction. Conversely, if pressure is high and PCV isn’t fully open, the valve might be malfunctioning (not responding to control signal).
Also check if any PSV is leaking (“passing”) – a slightly open PSV can cause loss of pressure control and unusual readings. In fact, records show instances of PSV-4050/4051 passing (leaking) when they shouldn’t1, which requires maintenance.
Differential Pressure: If the pressure drop across the heat exchangers increases (detected by comparing inlet vs outlet pressure of the exchanger bank), it usually means fouling or blockage in the exchangers. Normally, clean gas/gas exchangers have minimal pressure drop. A rising trend indicates internal resistance:
Check for hydrate formation inside if MEG injection dropped (ice can plug passages).
Or gradual fouling by contaminants (e.g., if inlet gas wasn’t perfectly clean or glycol carryover causing deposits).
Immediate action: Consider bypassing one exchanger at a time to see if a particular unit is causing the drop (the pressure profile might identify which exchanger is fouled). Plan for cleaning at next shutdown. (The maintenance logs scheduling chemical cleaning of exchangers corroborate this kind of issue1.)
Level and Flow Anomalies: Real-time level trends in V-405 can reveal issues:
If V-405 level is climbing steadily despite the LCV fully open, that suggests the level control valve or downstream piping is restricted. The condensate might not be evacuating (e.g., a blocked condensate line or stuck LCV). This can lead to high-level trips and potential carryover of liquid into the gas line.
If the level in V-405 is dropping too low frequently (and maybe the LCV is mostly closed trying to maintain it), perhaps the inflow of liquid has reduced unexpectedly – possibly indicating that not enough condensation is happening (performance issue upstream).
Detect via sensor: High-High level switches (LSHH) will alarm if levels exceed safe limits. Frequent triggering of LSHH-4051 is a sure sign of trouble that needs troubleshooting.
Control Valve Behavior: The control system provides continuous feedback on valve positions and effectiveness:
If PCV-4050 oscillates (hunting open/closed frequently), the control loop may be poorly tuned or encountering two-phase flow issues. This oscillation will show up as pressure oscillations in V-405. It might hint at incipient hydrate formation (partial blockage that clears and re-forms) or simply a tuning issue in the controller.
If an LCV (level control) oscillates and the level graph shows a sine wave, the level control loop might need tuning. However, it could also be caused by entrained gas in the liquid leg or a sticky valve. Real-time data from the level transmitter and valve output can help distinguish – if the valve output is steady but level still swings, it’s likely not a tuning issue but a process issue (like gas carry under or a flashing liquid).
Flow Imbalance & Production Data: Monitor condensate and water flow rates out of the separator compared to historical averages for the same gas throughput:
Any significant deviation should trigger an investigation. Maybe the composition of inlet gas changed (richer or leaner), but if not, it’s likely a performance issue.
MEG Injection Clues: The injection pressure and flow of MEG can be monitored at the injection pump. If the pump discharge pressure is lower than normal, maybe a pump is malfunctioning or a line is leaking. If the MEG flow rate drops, expect hydrate problems to soon follow:
Early signs of hydrate formation include unexpected pressure drop spikes and sometimes temperature spikes (exothermic) or erratic flow. Real-time data may show a sudden drop in separator pressure followed by a jump – a hydrate plug might have formed and then suddenly melted. These are complex signals, but a trained eye on trends can catch them.
The safest indicator is actually preventative: if MEG tank level isn’t reducing as expected (meaning no MEG is being injected), that’s a problem. The system should alarm on low MEG flow.
In practice, modern plants might also use performance dashboards or even AI anomaly detection on these sensor feeds to get alerts when any parameter strays from its normal correlation. But even without advanced tools, an operator can manually apply the “if this reading, then that issue” logic to diagnose problems, as detailed next.
Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues
When a potential performance problem is detected, a systematic troubleshooting approach helps isolate and resolve it. Below are common issues, symptoms (“if this happens”) and how to investigate/fix (“then that likely means / do this”):
Heat Exchanger Fouling or Inefficiency
If the inlet gas temperature to JT valve is higher than normal (exchangers not cooling enough), then one or more heat exchangers are not performing optimally. This could be due to fouling, scaling, or one exchanger being bypassed inadvertently. Action: Check temperature drops across each exchanger (one may have a much smaller ΔT). Also compare pressure drop across each – a fouled exchanger might also show higher ΔP. If confirmed, plan cleaning. In the interim, you might reduce flow rate to achieve required cooling or lower the JT valve pressure setpoint to compensate (at the cost of efficiency). Note any increase in fuel gas consumption or utility usage if any cooler fans or pumps exist, as that can also hint at trying to compensate for fouling.
Hydrate Formation
If you observe rapid pressure fluctuations or a sudden drop in flow accompanied by temperature anomalies, then suspect hydrate formation partially blocking the flow. Another clue is PCV-4050 needing to open more than usual to maintain pressure or not being able to maintain pressure. Action: Immediately check MEG injection rate and confirm the glycol pump is running and injection points are not plugged. Increase glycol dosage if necessary. In some cases, you may need to slowly warm the system or recycle gas to melt the hydrate. Also, check temperature at risky points (like JT valve outlet and low spots) – if below hydrate formation temp due to insufficient glycol, that’s the cause. To prevent recurrence, ensure glycol concentration and distribution (all seven injection points) are correct4, and consider slightly upping the separator pressure (warms the temperature) until the issue is resolved.
JT Valve Malfunction or Capacity Limit
If the JT (PCV-4050) is wide open but upstream pressure remains high (or it cannot reach the target separator pressure), then either the gas flow is exceeding design or the valve is partially obstructed/sized incorrectly. It might also indicate that the upstream heat exchangers didn’t precool enough (making the required pressure drop larger than the valve can provide). Action: Check actual flow vs. design. If flow is too high, you’re pushing the skid beyond capacity – consider cutting back production or accept higher separator pressure (with possibly reduced liquid recovery). If flow is within design, inspect PCV-4050: it could have trim damage or erosion causing ineffective throttling. A “passing” JT valve (leaking when should be closed) can also upset pressure control – e.g., maintenance logs noted PCV-4050 passing issues requiring repair1. Check the valve’s downstream temperature: if it’s not as low as expected even at high differential pressure, something’s off internally. If immediate replacement isn’t possible, one might operate in a manual choke mode using the valve and monitor closely. Long term, servicing or resizing the valve (if this is a chronic capacity issue due to plant debottlenecking) is needed.
Cold Separator Inefficiency (Liquid Carryover)
If liquid is carrying over into the gas outlet (evidenced by downstream scrubber V-406 collecting significant liquid or high-frequency of high level in V-405), then the separator V-405 might be overwhelmed or malfunctioning. Possible causes: too high gas velocity (from increased throughput), a damaged mist eliminator, or improper level control.
Action: Check V-405 liquid levels and LCV operation. If level is constantly high, troubleshoot the LCV-4052/53 (could be a stuck valve or a blocked line). If level is normal but carryover persists, inspect the mist eliminator pad in V-405 (it could be torn or missing). Also consider gas throughput: is it above the separator design? If yes, even a perfect separator will carry over. The solution might be to reduce flow or install additional separation capacity. In Khor Mor, the addition of V-406 scrubber was precisely to catch carryover at high rates5, so it’s a clue that carryover can occur if pushing the system. If V-406 is showing liquid, that’s your sign. Eventually, you may need to schedule an opening of V-405 to physically inspect internal baffles and clean out any accumulated solids that might disturb separation.
Level Control Valve Issues
If a level control valve (LCV-4052 or 4053) oscillates or fails to hold setpoint, then there may be an issue with the control loop or the valve itself.
If the level graph looks saw-tooth and the valve output is swinging, it might be simply a tuning issue – one can adjust the PID controller settings to dampen the oscillation.
But if the valve is, say, 100% open and level still doesn’t drop sufficiently (i.e., valve maxed out), suspect a valve or downstream restriction. Action: Verify the downstream path (e.g. condensate export line) is clear – a partially shut manual valve or plugged strainer could choke it. Also check instrument air supply to the valve actuator – loss of air can freeze a valve in place. In an emergency, a quick fix for a stuck valve could be to switch it to manual and operate it or use the bypass line if one exists to drain the separator. Ultimately, you’d likely need to repair or replace the valve. (Regular stroke testing during maintenance can help catch a sticky LCV before it causes problems.)
Instrument Sensor Faults
If sensor readings are inconsistent or implausible, then an instrument may be faulty rather than the process. For example, if one temperature element shows an odd value that doesn’t match others, or a flow transmitter drops to zero but everything else looks normal, the device might have failed. In one case, the flow transmitter FT-4050 had a “faulty reading issue”1 causing confusion about rates. Action: Cross-verify with redundant instruments if available (e.g., compare two temperature readings on the same stream). For a suspected bad transmitter, schedule a calibration check. Many modern systems have diagnostics (like heartbeat for flow meters) that can alert to sensor health. Until fixed, use secondary indicators: e.g., if the flow meter is down, infer flow from well tests or other upstream data; if a temperature sensor fails, perhaps use the adjacent temperature or a manual reading with an IR camera as a stopgap.
MEG Injection Problems
If you start seeing signs of hydrates or unusual pressure drops and suspect glycol issues, or if the water content in the gas starts rising, then the MEG injection system may be under-performing. Perhaps the MEG pump is not injecting the required amount, or the concentration is off.
Action: Check the MEG tank level and injection pump status first – there could simply be a pump trip or empty tank (human error, but it happens). If injection is ongoing but hydrates still form, the glycol may be diluted (maybe fresh water entered the system or the regen unit isn’t achieving target purity). Increase injection rate if possible as an immediate mitigation. Also monitor the rich MEG being recovered: if significantly less MEG is coming back than being injected, there might be a leak or it’s accumulating somewhere (e.g., in the process if temperatures are too low). The cure for chronic hydrate issues is to ensure the MEG circulation rate and concentration match the worst-case cooling. This can involve adjusting regen parameters or injection distribution (make sure all injection points are actually delivering – a blocked quill could leave part of the gas unprotected).
Another clue: if differential pressure across the glycol filters spikes, injection rate might drop – those filters should be monitored and changed to keep flow going (the HAZOP recommended differential pressure alarms on filters to catch this sort of thing6, though that was about a different filter, the principle stands).
Pressure Safety Valve Issues
If a PSV is frequently venting or found leaking (audible hissing at PSV or a downstream flare knock-out drum level rising unexpectedly from PSV releases), then either the system is running too close to the safety limit or the PSV itself is not sealing properly.
Frequent PSV lifting indicates an underlying issue: possibly the control valve (PCV) setpoint is too high or malfunctions, or pressure surges (maybe from slugs of liquid flash) are occurring. Action: Investigate why pressure is getting that high – e.g., did someone increase the separator pressure setpoint? Is there a slow response in PCV? You might need to lower the setpoint or repair the PCV. Also examine the PSV: sometimes after a relief event, PSVs don’t reseat perfectly and “simmer.” If PSV-4051 is passing slightly1, it will need to be re-lapped or replaced. In the meantime, one can very slightly increase the separator pressure setpoint to try to reseat it (not above safe limits, of course) or apply a back-pressure if possible. However, the real fix is servicing the valve under safe conditions.
Note: any PSV activation should be treated seriously; they are last line of defense. If one ever goes off, a thorough review should follow. Real-time data around that moment (pressure trends, valve positions) will help pinpoint the cause.
General Throughput vs. Performance
“If This, Then That” – Performance Relations Summary
Below is a quick reference list of symptoms (conditions) and their likely causes or required actions. It ties together the various parts of the JT skid and the cause-effect relationships:
If the temperature drop across the heat exchangers decreases (hot gas isn’t cooled enough) then the exchangers are likely fouled or not getting enough cold fluid. Action: Check for fouling, clean exchangers, or ensure cold gas/condensate return is sufficient.
If the pressure drop across the heat exchangers increases (more resistance to flow) then there may be blockage or hydrate formation in the exchangers. Action: Check MEG injection, consider warming or cleaning the exchangers, and monitor for hydrate conditions.
If the JT valve (PCV-4050) is at 100% open but cannot maintain set pressure then the flow is too high or the valve is undersized/partially blocked. Action: Reduce throughput or inspect the valve for issues (trim erosion, ice, etc.).
If the JT outlet temperature is higher than expected then the gas isn’t being expanded/cooled sufficiently. Likely causes: exchangers underperforming (gas entering JT too warm) or JT valve not creating enough drop. Action: Check upstream cooling and PCV operation.
If separator V-405 pressure is trending high then the PCV may be not controlling properly or a downstream restriction (like a partially closed valve or undersized flare line) is present. Action: Inspect PCV operation, ensure flare/vent path is clear (remember the note about RO sizing for blowdown4 – a similar concept can apply during normal venting).
If PSV-4051 lifts or is found leaking then separator pressure exceeded safe limit or PSV seat is bad. Action: Investigate control valve issues and process upsets that led to overpressure; service the PSV.
If liquid level in V-405 is persistently high then the condensate LCV-4052 or water LCV-4053 isn’t removing liquid fast enough. Likely causes: valve failure, blockage, or too much liquid inflow. Action: Check valve status, open bypass if needed, and examine downstream equipment for problems (e.g. is condensate tank or glycol unit receiving flow?).
If dry gas (outlet) moisture or dew point starts to worsen then the cooling and dehydration process is not effective. Likely causes: insufficient cooling (exchangers/JT issue) or insufficient MEG (hydrates might not form but water remains in gas). Action: Verify exchanger performance and MEG injection rates; consider lowering separator temperature further if possible or increasing MEG.
If unusual oscillations in pressure or level control loops occur then a control tuning or valve hardware issue is likely. Action: Suppress oscillations by switching to manual control if safe, or adjust PID settings; check for sticking control valves.
If the downstream scrubber V-406 starts collecting liquid regularly then V-405 is experiencing carryover. Likely cause: approaching or exceeding capacity, or faulty separation internals. Action: Reduce rate or improve separation (e.g. replace demister, lower V-405 pressure to help separation, etc.).
If MEG pump pressure is low or injection flow drops then little to no glycol is entering the system. Action: Fix the injection pump or refill MEG; anticipate hydrate formation until normal injection resumes (you might pre-emptively raise separator temp or pressure slightly during the outage to avoid issues).
If a flow or temperature sensor reading suddenly goes blank or unrealistic then the instrument has likely failed. Action: Don’t assume the process changed – verify the reading with backups. Switch to manual estimate or redundant sensor, and schedule instrument maintenance.
If any emergency shutdown occurs or the plant trips then after addressing the cause, perform a thorough performance check upon restart. Often trips (due to, say, a compressor or power issue) can shock the system – e.g., a sudden shutdown can cause a temperature spike or hydrate formation. So when coming back online, carefully monitor all sensors for any lagging issues (like a slightly flooded separator or valves not returning to normal automatically).
