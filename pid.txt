EPF Heat Exchanger System (JT Skid)

1. System Overview
The EPF JT skid is designed to cool high-pressure natural gas so that valuable liquids (condensate and water) can be separated before the gas is sent to the sales pipeline. Cooling is achieved by passing the gas through several heat exchangers and then rapidly dropping its pressure across a special valve (JT valve), which causes further cooling and condensation of liquids. The system ensures the gas meets pipeline quality and maximizes recovery of valuable products.

2. Key Elements and Components
-Heat Exchangers (E-401A/B/C, E-403A/B, E-402): These units cool the incoming gas using cold fluids (either outgoing dry gas or cold condensate). Multiple exchangers work in parallel for efficiency and flexibility.
-JT Valve (PCV-4050): This valve drops the gas pressure, causing a sharp temperature drop (Joule-Thomson effect) and further condensation.
-Cold Separator (V-405): After cooling, the gas enters this vessel, where liquids (condensate and water/glycol) are separated from the dry gas.
-Cold Gas Scrubber (V-406): A backup separator that catches any remaining liquid droplets before the gas goes to compressors or the pipeline.
-Glycol Injection System: Injects glycol to prevent ice (hydrate) formation in cold conditions.
-Control Valves and Safety Devices: Maintain proper levels, pressures, and safe operation throughout the system.

3. Gas Flow Process
-Inlet: High-pressure gas enters the JT skid from upstream separators.
-Pre-Cooling: Gas splits into several paths and passes through heat exchangers, cooling down by transferring heat to cold fluids.
-JT Expansion: The cooled gas recombines and passes through the JT valve, dropping pressure and temperature sharply.
-Separation: The cold, two-phase mixture enters the cold separator, where liquids settle out and dry gas rises.
-Re-Warming: Dry gas is warmed up by passing through the heat exchangers again, then sent to the sales pipeline or compressors.
-Liquid Handling: Separated liquids are sent for further processing or recycling (glycol is reclaimed and reused).

4. How to Analyze Performance
-Monitor Key Readings: Track pressures, temperatures, liquid levels, and flow rates at each stage.
-Check for Deviations: Compare real-time data to normal operating values. Unusual readings (e.g., high separator level, low temperature drop, valve positions) can signal problems like fouling, hydrate formation, or equipment malfunction.
-Troubleshooting: Use “if this, then that” logic—e.g., if the JT outlet temperature is too high, check upstream cooling and valve operation; if liquid carryover occurs, inspect separator and control valves.
